This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development related to asynchronous component rendering.  The `AsyncComponentBug.js` file shows the problematic code, where a component is used before its asynchronous import is fully resolved. This leads to a runtime error.  The solution, presented in `AsyncComponentSolution.js`, utilizes techniques like Promise-based loading and conditional rendering to prevent this issue, ensuring smooth asynchronous component integration in your application.
