This error occurs when you try to use a component that is defined asynchronously (e.g., using dynamic import) within a component that is rendered before the asynchronous component has loaded.  This frequently happens with lazy loading of components or images.  React Native might try to render the component before the import is complete, leading to a runtime error or unexpected behavior.
